# RAMP-Project : Predicting Air Traffic Passengers

This project is part of a collaborative data science challenge on the RAMP platform. The goal consists of expanding the limited dataset, which was donated by an unnamed airline company handling flight ticket reservations all across the U.S, and building a machine learning model to predict the number of air passengers. The prediction of air passengers at a given time will enable to efficiently allocate planes amongst possible routes. This was achieved by first adding external data to the original dataset, then exploring several ensemble methods to achieve high predictive performance. Finally, the quality of our model was measured by the root mean square error (RMSE), which we attempted to minimize by manipulating our data, trying out several machine learning models and tuning their parameters.
